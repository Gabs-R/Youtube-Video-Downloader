# Youtube-Video-Downloader 📽️⭕
**Hello everyone!**

In this projected, I created a Youtube-Video-Downloader that's capable of downloading videos from an Youtube URL(-links-) and insert it into a paste of your choice.

While creating this projected, I thought about the many things that people complain about, which is that some videos are really good but they cannot pay for an Youtube subscription to view the video later.

Thinking of this problem, I saw an opportunity to demonstrate that it's possible to download certain Youtube videos as a fun and non-lucrative project.
